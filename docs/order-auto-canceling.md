# Orders' auto canceling

![How can transactions affect it](./images/oa-balance-affect.svg)

## Node's behavior

A transaction is removed from UTX only if it:
* Become failed
* Confirmed

A transaction become failed only by failing transaction's conditions (e.g. expired).

A transaction could be added to UTX again during rollbacks. This leads to events in UTX `(1)`.
```scala
// ExtensionAppender.scala:
utxStorage.addAndCleanup(droppedBlocks.flatMap { case (b, _) => b.transactionData })
```

There is also an issue when a liquid block is removed from the memory, but haven't yet written to the disk. This may lead to invalid balances responses during this time `(3)`.

## Blockchain Events (BE) Extension client behavior

In the stream a transaction may be:
* Confirmed
* Unconfirmed
* Failed

We wait for a next micro block or a block during rollbacks. This helps to minimize the number of `(1)`, but it is still possible.
We have a deduplication cache in `OrderEventsCoordinatorActor` to minimize this further `(2)`.

## Matcher Extension (ME) client behavior

During sending (see [WavesBlockchainApiGrcpService#checkedBroadcast](blob/master/waves-ext/src/main/scala/com/wavesplatform/dex/grpc/integration/services/WavesBlockchainApiGrpcService.scala#L153)) we can observe that a transaction:
* Is confirmed
* Is not confirmed and was added
* Is not confirmed and was in UTX before
* Become failed, and we can't retry because of transaction's issues
* Become failed, and we can retry (see [WavesBlockchainApiGrcpService#canRetry](blob/master/waves-ext/src/main/scala/com/wavesplatform/dex/grpc/integration/services/WavesBlockchainApiGrpcService.scala#L183)):
  * Transaction doesn't fit UTX either by number or size limit;
  * Concurrency issues (see "Too much" in the code).

## Cases

AddressActor should receive events about a transaction only once. `(2)` protects against such situations.

⛔️ no retries
꩜️ retries are allowed
🆕 a transaction is new
💿 a transaction already in the UTX

🟥 - highly possible
🟧 - possible
🟨 - happens rarely
⬜ - impossible

Here is not all cases, but most interesting.
